# CRUMBS: Treasure Every Second of Your Travel

A progressive web app (PWA) that transforms fragmented travel moments into meaningful experiences while supporting local communities and environmental sustainability.

## About This Demo

**Note: This is a demo version using seed data.** The AI-driven personalization and open data integration features are planned for the next development phase.

## What CRUMBS Does

CRUMBS helps travelers make the most of their time gaps by providing AI-powered trip planning that seamlessly fits local culture, food, and eco-spots into available time slots. Our token-based ecosystem enables users to:

- Purchase curated trip experiences
- Earn tokens by reviewing locations and adding new spots
- Donate tokens to plant trees through our ESG initiatives
- Exchange tokens for partner coupons and local business support

## Key Highlights

- **AI-Powered Trip Planning**: Intelligent algorithms that match destinations to available time slots
- **Token Economy**: Community-driven system supporting local businesses and environmental causes
- **ESG Focus**: Tree-planting initiatives and sustainable tourism practices
- **Progressive Web App**: Cross-platform accessibility with native app-like experience
- **Community Building**: User-generated content and reviews that enhance the platform

## Inspiration

We're inspired by the untapped joy in Hong Kong's fragmented travel moments—a chance to connect travelers with local culture and nature. CRUMBS was born from a sincere desire to enhance experiences, support microbusinesses, and plant trees through tokens, embedding ESG as a heartfelt mission to sustain our world.

## How We Built It

Using agile methodology and design thinking, we created a comprehensive PRD outlining our MVP:

- **P0**: Trip planning functionality
- **P1**: Token system implementation

Built with Next.js for seamless PWA cross-platform access, integrating maps, authentication, and backend features while maintaining focus on intuitive UI flows, accessibility, and eco-conscious design.

## Roadmap

### Current Phase (Demo)

- Basic trip planning interface
- Token display and management
